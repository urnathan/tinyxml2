TinyXML-2 (C++ Module Demonstration)
====================================

This repo uses tinyxml2 as an example of converting an existing library
to C++-20 modules.  There's an associated CPPcon 2019 talk to go with this.
Other than changes for the conversion there's nothing exciting here.

This is a cut down repository and I've only built and tested for a
Linux host.  YMMV on other systems.  Go see Lee Thomason's git hub
(https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2) for the real thing.

Thanks Lee Thomason for creating tinyxml2 as a small-enough library for me
to use for this conversion, and licensing it in such a way that I may use it
for that.

Nathan Sidwell is the author of the conversion.
